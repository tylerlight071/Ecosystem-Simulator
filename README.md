# Ecosystem Simulation 🌿🐇🦊🐺

Welcome to the Ecosystem Simulation! This application simulates the dynamics of an ecosystem with rabbits, foxes, and wolves. Experience the balance of nature as these creatures interact and survive in their environment.

## Overview

This C++ application uses a simple model to simulate the population dynamics of rabbits, foxes, and wolves within an ecosystem. The simulation takes into account reproduction, predation, energy gain and loss, and random events such as disease outbreaks.

## Features

- **Population Dynamics**: Watch as populations of rabbits, foxes, and wolves evolve over time.
- **Interactions**: See how predators hunt prey and how energy levels affect survival.
- **Random Events**: Experience the unpredictability of nature with random disease outbreaks and deaths.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, simply compile the provided C++ source code and execute the resulting executable file.

```bash
g++ -o ecosystem_simulation ecosystem_simulation.cpp
./ecosystem_simulation
```

## Simulation

The simulation runs for 100 time steps, displaying the population dynamics and events at each step. Press Enter to advance to the next time step and witness the ecosystem in action.

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ Library
- Compatible Terminal/Command Prompt

## Parameters

- Initial Population: 32 rabbits, 17 foxes, and 6 wolves
- Maximum Population: 500 for each species
- Reproduction Rates and Energy Levels: Tuned for realistic ecosystem dynamics

## Note

This simulation is a simplified model for educational and entertainment purposes. Real ecosystems are far more complex and dynamic.
